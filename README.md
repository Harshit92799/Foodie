🍽️ About This Project – Foodie: Hostel Food Delivery & Booking System

Foodie is a full-stack web application designed to simplify food ordering for hostel students by bringing restaurants, menus, and delivery services into one unified platform.
The system allows students to explore restaurants, browse menus, place food orders, and receive door-to-door delivery directly to their hostel rooms. It also features a built-in feedback system, helping restaurants improve their service quality.
